Tests and notes for n_crypter
LU: 08/13/16
=============================

NOTES:
  n_crypter is almost fully functional, but the directory to be encrypted and the file extension to encrypt need to be specified in the code. A GUI might also be another good feature.

Problems:
  - pyinstaller does NOT work well with Tkinter.
  - Consider focusing on separate platforms for n_crypter.
    1) Mac OS X
    2) Windows
    3) Android
    4) iOS

Encryption tests:
  - PDFs
  - Applications


Passed Tests: (i.e. decrypt successfully without any problems)
  - Text files
  - Pictures
  - Files with spaces in their names
  - Files in deeper directories
  - .pages files
  - Music files
