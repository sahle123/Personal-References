CSCI 4229 Final Project, Clank
	Sahle Alturaigi
========================

Controls For program:
	1 = Orthogonal
	2 = Perspective (default)
	0 = Front view of object

	UP 				= Pan up
	DOWN 			= Pan down
	LEFT 			= rotate left
	RIGHT 			= rotate right
	SHIFT + UP 		= rotate up
	SHIFT + DOWN 	= rotate down

	q = zoom in
	w = zoom out

	a = toggles cartesian grid
	s = toggles lighting

	// The cool stuff is here //
	d = standing animation (default)
	f = waving animation 
	g = "Praise the sun" animation
	z = My old version of clank (You can see a big difference)
	
Summary:

	* Time invested into Blender == 22 hours
	* Time invested into OpenGL  == 34 hours (A LOT of refactoring had to be done)

	This project was a lot of fun. (I had spent entire nights without sleeping)
	I made my model inside Blender and all the work I did in their is entirely my own. 
	I did not take from anybody else--that is why I have quite a few hours logged into Blender. 
	Once I had created my objects in Blender and set their origin points correctly, I called them 
	inside separate display lists in which I had animations performed on. Most of the logic for 
	this project is inside my header file "clank_builder.h". I had do so much refactoring to get 
	this to work correctly and keep my code neat. The most important methods inside my class are 
	"compile_clank" and all the methods that end in "_render". So to speak, "compile_clank" sort 
	of worked as an int main for my class where it would call the right animation from class. The 
	animation is also handled as a function of time--NOT as a value that gets incremented. I 
	initially had my animations as the latter and to my dismay, when I overclocked my laptop, 
	the animations went wildly fast and that worried because the animation speed was entirely dependent
	on a persons processor. To remedy this, I used glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME) to get the proper amount 
	of time elapsed and with that I made an algorithm to redraw the object at the correct time frames 
	to keep the animation smooth and consistent.

	If you want to see the amount of progress I made, press the "Z" key to see the difference 
	between my first Clank object and my current one.

	Lastly, I am a little sad I could not invest more time into this project. I am taking 19 credit 
	hours this semester and I almost dropped this class because of it. I am glad I didn't. This is the 
	best I can do for now. Thank you for a great a semester!

Side Notes:

	* I attached the pictures of how I ideally wanted my model to look
	* I also attached the mocks I made to flesh out my model and how to do the animations
