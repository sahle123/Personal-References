This file contains my first attempt at creating a Red-black tree. Unfortunately, I do not think my appraoch was the most efficient and due to the setup of my class, implementing insert() and delete() proved to be far too difficult. 

The code will serve as an old reference of how not to do things or maybe I might actually find a way to make this code usable.
